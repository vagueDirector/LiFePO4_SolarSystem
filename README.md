# LiFePO4_SolarSystem
LiFePO4 Solar Energy Storage System / Double Conversion UPS

The aim of developing this was to make an ultimate system to power my electronics under all situations. The system is able to make use of any solar input that is available, with the remaining power requirements made up from the AC input. The AC charger is set to 13.2V, which keeps the battery from going below 50% state of charge. That way there is always power available, even when the AC grid is not available and solar is insufficient. The unit is ~80% efficient as a double conversion UPS, with ~95% efficiency on the AC charger and ~90% efficiency on the inverter. When solar generation is greater than load resuirements, excess energy is stored in the battery for use later in the day/night.
